2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BSCK-11#1 Warning
OSERDESE3_parallel_clock_nets  
OSERDESE3 cell uihdmitx_inst/Inst_clk_oserdese3_10to1/OSERDESE3_inst has sub-optimal clocking topology for pins uihdmitx_inst/Inst_clk_oserdese3_10to1/OSERDESE3_inst/CLK (driver: instance_name/inst/clkout3_buf) and uihdmitx_inst/Inst_clk_oserdese3_10to1/OSERDESE3_inst/CLKDIV (driver: instance_name/inst/clkout2_buf). These pins should be driven by parallel global clock buffers by utilizing BUFGCE_DIV cell for the OSERDESE3 CLKDIV pin.
Related violations: <none>

BSCK-11#2 Warning
OSERDESE3_parallel_clock_nets  
OSERDESE3 cell uihdmitx_inst/Inst_d0_serializer_10_1/OSERDESE3_inst has sub-optimal clocking topology for pins uihdmitx_inst/Inst_d0_serializer_10_1/OSERDESE3_inst/CLK (driver: instance_name/inst/clkout3_buf) and uihdmitx_inst/Inst_d0_serializer_10_1/OSERDESE3_inst/CLKDIV (driver: instance_name/inst/clkout2_buf). These pins should be driven by parallel global clock buffers by utilizing BUFGCE_DIV cell for the OSERDESE3 CLKDIV pin.
Related violations: <none>

BSCK-11#3 Warning
OSERDESE3_parallel_clock_nets  
OSERDESE3 cell uihdmitx_inst/Inst_d1_serializer_10_1/OSERDESE3_inst has sub-optimal clocking topology for pins uihdmitx_inst/Inst_d1_serializer_10_1/OSERDESE3_inst/CLK (driver: instance_name/inst/clkout3_buf) and uihdmitx_inst/Inst_d1_serializer_10_1/OSERDESE3_inst/CLKDIV (driver: instance_name/inst/clkout2_buf). These pins should be driven by parallel global clock buffers by utilizing BUFGCE_DIV cell for the OSERDESE3 CLKDIV pin.
Related violations: <none>

BSCK-11#4 Warning
OSERDESE3_parallel_clock_nets  
OSERDESE3 cell uihdmitx_inst/Inst_d2_serializer_10_1/OSERDESE3_inst has sub-optimal clocking topology for pins uihdmitx_inst/Inst_d2_serializer_10_1/OSERDESE3_inst/CLK (driver: instance_name/inst/clkout3_buf) and uihdmitx_inst/Inst_d2_serializer_10_1/OSERDESE3_inst/CLKDIV (driver: instance_name/inst/clkout2_buf). These pins should be driven by parallel global clock buffers by utilizing BUFGCE_DIV cell for the OSERDESE3 CLKDIV pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#1 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out2_5x_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 2 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins instance_name/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst/CLKOUT1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#2 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out5x_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 2 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins instance_name/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst/CLKOUT2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#3 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 2 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins instance_name/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#4 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clkfbout_clk_wiz_0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 2 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins instance_name/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT]
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-55#1 Advisory
MMCME3 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME3_ADV cell instance_name/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) instance_name/inst/clkin1_bufg and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
Related violations: <none>
